# Nexus-AI---JARVIS
 AI-powered virtual assistants that can perform tasks, answer questions, and even control other systems.
 
 JARVIS has the Core Components
 
Speech Recognition: A module for understanding spoken commands. You could use libraries like SpeechRecognition in Python with Google Web Speech API.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): To interpret and process commands, libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers could help with task parsing.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts text responses to speech; Google Text-to-Speech or pyttsx3 are good options for this.

Command Execution: Code that interprets the recognized text and executes corresponding commands, like opening applications, fetching information, etc.

Information Retrieval: Modules for answering general knowledge queries or retrieving information from the web.

Task Automation: Scripts to automate tasks such as opening applications, sending emails, setting reminders, or controlling IoT devices.

System Monitoring: Extensions to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage, which could integrate with a real-time monitoring dashboard.

Custom APIs: Integration with other APIs (weather, news, stock prices) to provide real-time updates.
